A web app for those of us who are familiar with IAST transliteration and wants to use this to learn the devanagari alphabet. The idea is simple: A sentence is displayed in sanskrit and the user should click the corresponding IAST syllables in the correct order.

Files:
index.html - Layout and stuff
data.js - All the sanskrit sentences together with their corresponding IAST transliteratin
deva.js - The app logic
